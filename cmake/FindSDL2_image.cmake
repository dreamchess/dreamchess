# - Locate SDL_image library
# This module defines:
#  SDL2_IMAGE_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link against
#  SDL2_IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
#  SDL2_IMAGE_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
#  SDL2_IMAGE_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing the version of SDL_image
#
# $SDLDIR is an environment variable that would
# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR
# used in building SDL.
#
# Created by Eric Wing. This was influenced by the FindSDL.cmake
# module, but with modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
# additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
