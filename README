1 - About
---------

DreamChess is a user interface for playing chess. It comes with its own
engine called Dreamer. Both DreamChess and Dreamer are compatible with the
xboard/Winboard chess engine communication protocol. This means that
DreamChess can be used with other xboard-compatible chess engines such as
crafty (ftp://ftp.cis.uab.edu/pub/hyatt/) and GNU Chess
(http://www.gnu.org/software/chess/). Similarly, the Dreamer chess engine can
be used with other xboard-compatible user interfaces such as xboard and
Winboard (http://www.tim-mann.org/xboard.html) and recent editions of the
commercial chess program Chessmaster (http://www.chessmaster.com/).

2 - System Requirements
-----------------------

The following platforms are currently officially supported:

 * UNIX (Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris etc)
 * Microsoft Windows (95 and above)
 * Sega Dreamcast
 * BeOS

2.1 - User Interface Drivers
----------------------------

DreamChess supports several user interface drivers which can be selected at
runtime. Requirements for these drivers vary and will be described per driver
below.

2.1.1 - sdlgl
-------------

This driver uses SDL as well as OpenGL. To avoid performance issues it is
recommended that you use a hardware-accelerated OpenGL library, if available.

The following libraries are required for this driver:

 * SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/)
 * SDL_image (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
 * OpenGL


3 - Building DreamChess
-----------------------

This chapter describes how to build and install DreamChess from source.
Building essentially consists of two steps:

   ./configure
   make

For more detailed information about this process, please read the INSTALL
file.

3.1 - Microsoft Windows
-----------------------

In order to build DreamChess in Windows you'll need to install the following:

 * MinGW (http://www.mingw.org/)
 * MSYS (http://www.mingw.org/msys.shtml)

This provides the environment necessary to run the configure script and
compile DreamChess.

3.2 - Sega Dreamcast
--------------------

Building the Dreamcast version can only be done by cross-compiling it on
another system. You'll need the following:

 * dc-toolchain-builder 0.2. (http://freesci.org/?page=dreamcast)

Follow the instructions in the enclosed README to set up the toolchain.
You'll also need the following software package from our website:

 * dreamcast-libs 0.7 (http://developer.berlios.de/projects/dreamchess/)

Again, follow the instructions in the enclosed README file to set it up.

To configure and compile DreamChess you need to first run the KallistiOS
environ script which you created during the setup process. After that use
the following commands to configure and compile DreamChess:

   ./configure --host=sh-elf CC=kos-cc CC_FOR_BUILD=gcc \
   SDL_CONFIG=$DREAMCAST_LIBS_BASE/SDL/sdl-config --datadir=/cd \
   --enable-linked-engine
   make

NOTE: The Dreamcast port is configured with the --enable-linked-engine option
which creates a single executable that includes the Dreamer engine. It is
therefore not possible to choose another engine at runtime.

3.3 - Installing DreamChess
---------------------------

You can use the following command to install DreamChess:

   make install

For more detailed information please read the INSTALL file. Note that this
will install DreamChess in your build environment, which is probably not what
you want if you're building for Windows or Dreamcast. Read the following two
sections for additional information concerning those platforms.

3.3.1 - Microsoft Windows
-------------------------

On Windows DreamChess is installed by running an NSIS installer package. This
section will describe how to create such an installer. Download and install:

 * NSIS (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/)

Download the necessary runtime DLLs:

 * SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/)
 * SDL_image (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)

Put the DLLs in the pkg/win32 directory. Run MakeNSISW and drag the
dreamchess.nsi file from the pkg/win32 directory onto the window. You should
now have an installer package in the pkg/win32 directory.

3.3.2 - Sega Dreamcast
----------------------

On Dreamcast you'll most likely want to make a bootable CD (there are other
ways of running DreamChess, but they won't be discussed here).

First you need to create a raw binary from the elf file that was built.
Change to the src directory and run:

   sh-elf-objcopy -R .stack -O binary dreamchess dreamchess.bin

In order for this binary to work on a bootable CD, it needs to be scrambled.
Download the 1ST_READ.BIN scrambler from http://mc.pp.se/dc/sw.html and
install it. Then run:

   scramble dreamchess.bin 1ST_READ.BIN

Now follow the tutorial at http://mc.pp.se/dc/cdr.html to create a bootable
CD. The iso image should contain the 1ST_READ.BIN file in the root directory.
It must also contain the complete data directory, renamed to dreamchess.

NOTE: In recent versions of cdrecord the -xa1 option was renamed to -xa.


4 - Subversion Repository
-------------------------

The DreamChess project uses a Subversion repository. This is where the
source code is kept as it gets updated between releases. If you want
to try out recent improvements and can't wait for the next release, you can
check out a copy of the source code and compile it. Note that the source code
you obtain in this way has not gone through the regular testing phase that
happens before each release. It is therefore not unlikely that it contains
serious bugs.

In order to check out source code from the Subversion repository and build
it you need the following additional tools:

 * GNU automake (http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/)
 * GNU autoconf (http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)
 * Subversion (http://subversion.tigris.org/)
 * GNU bison (http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
 * Flex (http://flex.sourceforge.net/)

Change to a suitable directory and run the following command:

   svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/dreamchess/dreamchess/trunk dreamchess

This will check out the source code and place it in a dreamchess
subdirectory. Now change to that directory and run:

   autoreconf -i

This should generate a configure script. You can now follow the regular build
instructions in chapter 3.

NOTE: Should you ever want to update this checkout you can do this:

   svn up
   autoreconf


5 - Running DreamChess
----------------------

You can start the game by running the dreamchess executable. Here's an
overview of the command-line options:

Usage: dreamchess [options]

An xboard-compatible chess interface.

Options:
  --help                -h              Show help.
  --list-drivers        -l              List all available drivers.
  --ui <drv>            -u<drv>         Use user interface driver <drv>.
  --fullscreen          -f              Run in fullscreen.
  --width <num>         -W<num>         Set screen width.
  --height <num>        -H<num>         Set screen height.
  --1st-engine <eng>    -1<eng>         Use <eng> as first chess engine.
                                           Defaults to `dreamer'.

NOTE: It's not possible to specify command-line arguments when running the
Dreamcast version of DreamChess.

Once DreamChess is running you can use ALT+ENTER or F11 to toggle fullscreen,
and CTRL+F to toggle a FPS display(can only be used on the title screen).

5.1 - Running Dreamer
---------------------

You generally don't want to run Dreamer directly. If you want to use Dreamer
with another user interface, please consult that program's documentation on
how to specify that the dreamer engine should be used.
