*** 2007-11-17 - DreamChess v0.2.0 ***

Over a year has passed since the first release, and we are now happy to
present DreamChess v0.2.0. DreamChess is a 3D chess game for Windows, Mac OS X
and Linux. The new release can be downloaded from our website at
http://www.dreamchess.org.

The main new feature is sound support. Matthew P. Smith was kind of enough to
allow us to use some of his songs in the game. The music pack containing these
songs is available for download from our website.

Graphically the game has been improved significantly. This was made possible
by the decision to drop the Dreamcast port (see below). The old 3D models have
been replaced by new models with a lot more detail. Other improvements include
reflections, hardware lighting, new textures, and a new sketch theme by
Annie Kirkpatrick.

The GUI has seen many small improvements, such as additional options that
could previously only be set from the command line. A new feature is the
"easy mode" (for those who felt that our engine Dreamer put up too much of a
fight even on Level 1).

DreamChess is now also available for Mac OS X by courtesy of Lawrence Sebald.
Unfortunately, we were forced to drop support for Dreamcast and BeOS. If
you're interested in picking up these ports, please send an email to
feedback at dreamchess.org.

We hope you enjoy this new release!

About DreamChess:

DreamChess (http://www.dreamchess.org) is an open source chess game. Our
primary target platforms are Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. DreamChess features
3D OpenGL graphics and provides various chess board sets, ranging from classic
wooden to flat figurines.

A moderately strong chess engine is included: Dreamer. However, should this
engine be too weak for you, then you can use any other XBoard-compatible
chess engine, including the popular Crafty and GNU Chess.

Other features include music, sound effects, on-screen move lists using SAN
notation, undo functionality, and savegames in PGN format.

The DreamChess team currently consists of only a handful of people. We could
use help in many areas, such as programming, graphics, sound and testing. If
